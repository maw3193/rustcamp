First up, I love that you referenced "falsehoods programmers believe...".

Your `TryFrom` implementation, however, could have been a lot simpler (though
perhaps with one fewer error message) if you'd just used `value.split_once(':')`
which was what I was hoping people would find.

Your use of the hashmap entry API was perfect, well done.

Buuuut, your `Display` method for the scores failed to take into account
plural vs. singular for `test`. :(
